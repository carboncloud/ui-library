# CarbonCloud UI Library

This UI library is used internally at CarbonCloud to create a uniform user experience across multiple Elm applications.

We strive towards ease of use and good developer ergonomics whilst also making sure that each component is accessible and follows best practices.

Hopefully it is useful for someone else as well as a source of inspiration.
